# Contributing

## Pull requests only

__DON'T__ push to the master branch directly. Always use feature branches and let people discuss changes in pull requests.
Pull requests should only be merged after all discussions have been concluded and 2 reviewers have given theirs __approval__.

## Workflow

1. Create an issue and describe your idea
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
4. Publish the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
5. Create a new Pull Request

## Guidelines

- __every change__ needs a test
- keep the current code style powered by SwiftLint
- commit message should be in the following format:
```
#<issue_number>: <body>
```
